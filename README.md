# Telegram_Illness_predictor
We present a Telegram bot that uses a support vector machine (SVM) to predict illnesses based on symptoms provided by users. The bot receives symptoms from users via Telegram messages and uses the SVM to make a prediction about the potential illness. The bot then sends a response to the user with the prediction and information on doctor's appointment at the Unilag Health Center. We evaluated the performance of the Illness Predictor by comparing its predictions to those made by medical professionals. Our results showed that the Illness Predictor performed well, with a high level of accuracy and precision.
